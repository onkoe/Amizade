    <p>
      Amizade lets you install anything over ocs:// - including applications, icons, cursors, themes, sound packs, scripts, screensavers, extensions, and much more!

      It connects to OCS, also known as the Open Collaboration Services API! Websites like Pling and its derivatives, such as GNOME-Look or KDE-Look, often use these, giving you access to everything these sites have to offer... All from your Linux desktop!
